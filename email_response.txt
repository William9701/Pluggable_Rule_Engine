Subject: Django Pluggable Rule Engine - Project Submission

Hello,

I have successfully completed the Django Pluggable Rule Engine project.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/William9701/Pluggable_Rule_Engine
Live Demo: https://pluggable-rule-engine.onrender.com

The project includes:
• Order model with 3 seeded orders
• Pluggable rule engine with auto-registration
• 3 rules implemented: min_total_100, min_items_2, divisible_by_5
• POST /rules/check/ API endpoint working as specified
• Interactive Swagger UI for testing
• Comprehensive tests (all passing)
• Professional commit history

You can test the API directly in the browser using the Swagger UI at the live demo link above.

Thank you!

Best regards
